# Regularization and Optimization

## The solution for bias and varance

**If bias:**

- Bigger network (deeper or bigger layer)
- Train longer
- Find neuro network architecture

**If variance:**

- More training data
- Regularization 
- Find neuro network architecture

## Regularization

1. **L2 regularization**
   - $J(w, b) = \cfrac{1}{m} $
2. **Dropout regularization**
